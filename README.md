# blockchain-gui
We are on a mission to build a more open, accessible, and fair financial future, one piece of software at a time. 
Our technology is revolutionizing the financial services industry by empowering millions across the globe to authenticate and transact immediately and without costly intermediaries.
A global network of computers uses blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. 
That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any one central authority. 
Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis.
In our project we are just explaining how the block cahin works
so enjoy and learn this blockchain
